#### Library with database

Same project as [ps_spring_rest (library without database)](https://github.com/DmytroAksonenko/ps_spring_rest_db) but with database.

`In this task, you need to select a subject area within which there should be 2 entities with a many-to-one relationship. Create REST services that return lists of entities and implement support for CRUD operations for one of the entities.` ~~The repositories for these entities are kept in memory.~~
